# Machine-Learning
"Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed"

## Supervised Learning
### => Regression Algorithm
**Linear Regression:**
- Linear regression is a data analysis technique that predicts the value of unknown data by using another related and known data value.
- y = w.x + b
- They value of y can be any real number.

### => Classification Algorithm
**Logistic Regression:**
- Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm widely used for binary classification tasks, such as identifying whether an email is spam or not and diagnosing diseases by assessing the presence or absence of specific conditions based on patient test results.
- y = g(z) and where z = w.x + b.
- They vlaue if y lies between 0 and 1.
