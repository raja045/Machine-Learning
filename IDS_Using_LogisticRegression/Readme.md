## Project Overview
This Intrusion Detection System (IDS) project aims to identify and classify network intrusions using machine learning techniques. The system processes network data, extracts relevant features, and applies a trained model to detect potential security threats.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracts new features to improve model performance.
- **Model Training**: Trains various machine learning models and evaluates their performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: Uses metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.

## Dependencies
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## How to Run the Project
1. **Set Up Environment**
    - Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or above).
    - Create a virtual environment:
      ```bash
      python -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
      ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
    - Install the required libraries:
      ```bash
      pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
      ```

3. **Run the Notebook**
    - Launch Jupyter Notebook:
      ```bash
      jupyter notebook
      ```
    - Open `Intrusion_Detection_System.ipynb` and run the cells sequentially.
